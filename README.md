This is a javascript snow crash.

1.  Do in in canvas with just random noise.
2.  Do it in canvas with a digital-to-analog-to-digital conversion of some sort.
3.  Impair that conversion on the analog spectrum and see if you can't replicate some of the types of snow crashes that display partial data.
